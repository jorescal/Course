Databases and SQL for Data Science



When data is stored in tabular form, the data is organized in tables like in a spreadsheet, which is columns and rows. That's a relational database.A table is a collection of related things like a list of employees or a list of book authors. In a relational database, you can form relationships between tables.



A relational database stores data in a tabular format - i.e. in rows and columns. But not all types of databases use the tabular format.



We will discuss these 5 basic SQL queries in further detail in subsequent lessons:

CREATE

INSERT

SELECT

UPDATE

DELETE




* Data definition language or DDL statements are used to define, change, or drop data. 

* Data manipulation language or DML statements are used to read and modify data.



COUNT is a built-in database function that retrieves the number of rows that match the query criteria. select COUNT(*) from tablename. 

DISTINCT is used to remove duplicate values from a result set.

LIMIT is used for restricting the number of rows retrieved from the database. Example, retrieve just the first 10 rows in a table. Select * from tablename LIMIT 10. Select * from MEDALS where YEAR = 2018 LIMIT 5.
